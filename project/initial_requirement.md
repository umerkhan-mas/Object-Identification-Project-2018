# Initial Requirement

Given a list of object from different modalities combine them to create a combined list.

Given the input :
1. [(knife,1, 99%), (scissor, 2, 65%), (spoon, 3, 33%), (spoon, 4, 80%), (keys, 5, 95%)]
2. [(knife,1, 55%), (scissor, 2, 95%), (fork, 3, 99%), (spoon, 4, 99%), (keys, 5, 95%) ]

The program should output
1. [(knife,1, 99%), (scissor, 2, 95%), (fork, 3, 99%), (spoon, 4, 99%), (keys, 5, 95%)]

## Break down of requirements
1. Select language of working 
2. Select the coding standard
3. Select testing framework
4. select the data structure you will use to communicate the object list to your code
5. Design the code structure along with the class/function type and define the class/function names
6. Decide on the input and output formats of data
6. Write test cases for the input and expected output
7. Make the test cases work and fail for expected outputs dont match
7. Write the actual implementation
8. Now pass the test cases



## Things to ponder
1. How wil you combine when the objects from both modalities dont match?
2. Will there be more sensors in future?
3. Will there be no output from a particular modality?
4. Will there be ...........


## Things to read
1. Design Patterns
2. S.O.L.I.D framework for software development


## Points
* 10 Working in group
* 10 Working with issues in github (converting requirements to github issues, commiting to them and closing them on completion)
* 10 Working with branch and using pull request to update the master code(No commit to master code)
* 40 TDD appraoch
* 10 Using Design Patterns
* 20 Solution
